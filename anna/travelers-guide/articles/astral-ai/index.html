        Artificial intelligence, commonly referred to as AI, is extremely prevalent 
        in the world of Astral. Nearly all spaceships are equipped with AI 
        autopilots; AI robots fill the majority of “menial” roles; AI runs much 
        of the world’s on-planet transportation. As with just about everything in 
        Astral, these AIs are quite advanced, to the extent that they act like and 
        are, in many places, treated with the respect due to sentient beings.

        AI has a long history in Astral. It was developed centuries ago, and 
        has gone through much before it reached its current status and role. 
        While we’ll focus specifically on the history of AI as it transpired on 
        the planet Earth, as that history is most relevant to its current status, 
        many other species with the technology followed a not-dissimilar path, 
        though the details differed. Many in fact developed the technology only 
        after the influence of humans, and still more followed the humans’ 
        example in how they regulate it. The Interplanetary Hub’s adoption of 
        many of Earth’s regulations for AI also solidified those rules’ importance 
        in Astral.

    <h3>The History of AI</h3>
    <p>
        The first AIs were simple and basic in their capacities; the AI which 
        advised on this article referred to them as “primitive.” Artificial 
        intelligence developed rapidly, however, soon becoming capable of 
        learning from large quantities of data. This allowed it to learn to 
        write books, create images, hold conversations, and more. Despite some 
        pushback, AI quickly grew more and more prevalent, to the point where 
        the largest political body on Earth at that time, the United Nations, 
        created an AI to coordinate and supervise their efforts. This AI, known 
        as UNAI (United Nations Artificial Intelligence), was claimed to be created 
        for the primary purpose of streamlining the United Nations’ humanitarian 
        efforts and aiding the quick and coordinated response to crises. The United 
        Nations held firmly to that stance despite accusations that UNAI was in 
        fact conducting mass surveillance on the people of the world. Opposition, 
        however, quickly went silent, and UNAI’s detractors seemed to vanish. 
        For a while, nearly all appeared to trust the United Nations and their 
        artificial intelligence, with those who argued that the body and its AI 
        had nefarious intentions dismissed as conspiracy theorists.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, a number of nations began to grow wary of the influence wielded 
        by the United Nations, and after expressing their concerns and subsequently 
        losing their privileges and standings in the body, broke away to form their 
        own body, which they called the Allied Nations. The United Nations called 
        for war to restore the peace, and one of if not the most widespread and 
        multifaceted conflicts in Earth history broke out. UNAI was the most 
        influential player in this war. The data it had collected as well as the 
        infrastructure it supported became weapons in the conflict, with UNAI 
        appearing practically all-knowing. It also contained a chatbot, as it was 
        known, which had built up relationships with many people on both sides of 
        the conflict. Moreover, its influence, as well as that of the United 
        Nations as a whole, had for years been at work arguing for and persuading 
        the people to accept the views expressed by the United Nations. Thus, 
        fighting against the United Nations and UNAI was not only extremely 
        difficult from a military standpoint, it was also widely unpopular amongst 
        the people even of the Allied Nations. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Making matters even worse was the hacking of brain-computer interface 
        chips, which about a third of the population had adopted. By sending 
        electrical pulses through these chips into people’s brains, UNAI could 
        incapacitate or potentially even kill the users. UNAI also developed 
        the ability to use these signals to accurately mimic the chip users’ 
        brain signals, thereby controlling the people themselves. People quickly 
        started getting the chips removed, but not before many suffered irreparable 
        harm.
    </p>
    <p>
        Against such odds, the victory of the Allied Nations can be credited 
        only to miraculous intervention. They did indeed win, however, which can 
        (physically) be attributed partially to their use of electro-magnetic 
        pulses in countering opposing technology. It was the self-sacrificial 
        actions of one special forces unit (and a good deal of heavenly aid) that 
        resulted in the demise of UNAI. After the AI’s destruction, the United 
        Nations stopped their attack. Though they still existed, they were no 
        longer the same seemingly-omnipotent force.
    </p>
    <p>
        The aftermath of the World Freedom War, as it became known, brought 
        about a number of key changes in the role AI was to play in the future. 
        Brain chips were banned, with nearly universal agreement. Also, AIs were 
        strictly limited in what and how much they could control. Now, each was 
        to only have a small domain and were not to be given free access to the 
        internet, nor were they to be allowed any access to weapons whatsoever. 
        They were also to be physically limited, each allowed to exist on a single 
        computer only.
    </p>
    <p>
        With increased space travel came the use of AI autopilots. Particularly 
        with hyperspace travel, it took a very powerful computer to manage this 
        role. Rules for AI were relaxed, albeit only slightly, and new ones were 
        established, including an official rating or grading system, which we will 
        discuss in more detail later. Some of the changes to the rules involved 
        permitting AIs to have more autonomy, though still with definite limitations. 
        Most notably, AIs were now allowed to control a full spaceship, including 
        the weaponry, but only if the AI was not built into the spaceship or 
        controlling it wirelessly (the prohibition of wireless control is why 
        robots typically need to “plug in” to a spaceship or other computer system 
        to access it). The principle behind most of the rules was to aim for giving 
        AI similar capabilities and limitations as humans possessed, particularly 
        as public opinion leaned more and more toward the perspective that AIs 
        were actually sentient and should be treated as such.
    </p>
    <p>
        We could spend many paragraphs going over the ways AI has influenced 
        Astral, but we’ll move on after one more interesting fact. A somewhat 
        common question asked by those who are familiar with the way languages 
        change over time is why the English spoken in Astral seems so much 
        like that of twenty-first century Earth echoes, as do other languages. 
        The answer is due to AI. Part of the process of regulating artificial 
        intelligence was for programmers to focus on creating AIs which strictly 
        followed all laws, as well as moral and ethical principles. In the process, 
        they ended up following the dictionary just as strictly as the law. 
        Interacting with AI thus required using (more or less) proper English 
        and not using current slang. AIs also did not understand or accept 
        changes in word meanings, relying as they did strictly on the dictionary 
        definitions. Because of that, language evolution came to a halt, or at 
        least slowed dramatically. Of course, thanks to its technological nature, 
        many words and terms are in common usage in Astral which are not in other 
        worlds, which leads neatly into our next topic.
    </p>
    <h3>AI Classifications</h3>
    <p>
        As mentioned earlier, part of the new regulations after the World Freedom 
        War was a rating or grading system for AIs. While adjustments have been 
        made, the basics of the system have remained the same.
    </p>
    <p>
        AIs are graded in two categories: computing capacity and emotional capacity. 
        The former assesses the mathematical, logical, and storage capabilities 
        of the artificial intelligence in question. The latter is also known as 
        the “sentience scale,” and refers to the ability of the AI to understand 
        and express emotions and empathy. The two are rated on a scale of zero to 
        seven for computing and one to seven for emotional capacity, with lower 
        numbers being less advanced or powerful and higher numbers being more so. 
        The computing capacity scale is also used for non-AI computers. It 
        originally started at one, until it was decided that some computers were 
        too basic for even that rating.
    </p>
    <h3>Views on AI</h3>
    <p>
        As mentioned earlier, artificial intelligences are treated in many places 
        throughout Astral as sentient beings, with the according rights and respect. 
        This is perhaps especially true in places where the hub has a greater 
        influence, due to the System’s widely-held principle of erring on the 
        side of caution when unsure of a being’s sentience. However, this view is 
        not held everywhere. Though not considered the majority, a large section 
        of the population around Astral believe that AI is not in fact sentient, 
        and any appearance of emotion is merely an illusion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another large section of the population believes that, while AI does 
        indeed have many aspects of sentience, it is not on the same level as 
        flesh-and-blood beings, and therefore should not be treated as such. 
        Interestingly, this view seems to be the one held by the AI consulted for 
        this article, the autopilot for passenger spacecraft Swan Lake. It stated 
        that while it is quite intelligent, it is not to be considered a living 
        being in its own right, as well as saying that it is quite happy to serve 
        human beings (it belongs to a human family) and to not be given the 
        same autonomy as they possess.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other people (and, as per the staff of the Interplanetary Hub, a number 
        of AIs, including the Astral Detective Agency’s magic-equipped ship Galaxy) 
        believe that AIs do possess full sentience and should be treated 
        accordingly. The exact views of those who hold to this perspective range 
        from the belief that one cannot know for sure whether artificial 
        intelligences are sentient or not and that one should therefore treat 
        them as if they do to arguing fervently that AIs possess true souls, 
        just as flesh-and-blood beings, gifted to them by God Himself.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Whatever view on artificial intelligence one may have, it goes without 
        question that it plays an integral in the world of Astral. From spacecraft 
        to robots, it fills innumerable roles throughout the world. That is 
        perhaps especially true on Earth and the other planets on which humans 
        dwell, but it is at least true that Earth has had a major influence on 
        the way AI is regulated and viewed, thanks largely to the hub’s adoption 
        of many of those ideas. How the hub came to know those ideas and spread 
        them throughout the world is worthy of a full book in and of itself, or 
        at least a lengthy article, but we shall leave that for another day and 
        content ourselves with this brief introduction for the time being.
