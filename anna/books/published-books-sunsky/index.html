        The skycats of the island of Aemryl have lived peaceably for centuries 
        with little ever changing. Young council member Sunfur never expected 
        anything to alter that. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        Then, disaster strikes Aemryl, forcing the skycats to search for a new 
        land to call home. Sunfur will find herself on a new path, one she never 
        imagined. Can she live up to her responsibility and find a new home for 
        her friends? One thing is for sure: Sunfur is on the adventure of a 
        lifetime, with new lands to be found and new friends to be made.
