    <h2>Other stories</h2>
    <p>
        While my one published book is written with kids in mind, most of the 
        ideas I’m currently working on are geared toward a young adult audience. 
        My mind likes to bounce from story to story and come up with new ideas 
        on a whim, so I have a LOT of works-in-progress at any given moment. 
        I’m also a lot better at starting stories than I am at finishing them, 
        so most of those aren’t especially far along. Because of that and 
        because my writing pace is typically fairly slow overall, I can’t 
        make any promises about when I’ll next finish a story. Hopefully 
        it will be soon, though!

        Currently the farthest-along book after “Sunsky” and “Kitty Cat, 
        Supercat” is titled “The Traveler’s Guide to Romance and Wraiths.” 
        When I started it, it grew from one page to around forty quite fast, 
        so that’s a promising sign.
