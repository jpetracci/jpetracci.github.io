        Welcome to my (current) website! (I will presumably get one that isn’t
         a subsidiary of my dad’s eventually, but for now this works just fine.)
         Here you can find information about my books, both the one I have published
         and hints about my plans for the future. I will also have bonus stories and 
         random extra material here as well. Enjoy!
