    <p>
        Welcome to my (current) website! (I will presumably get one that isn’t
         a subsidiary of my dad’s eventually, but for now this works fine.)
         Here you can find information about my books, both the one I have published
         and hints about my plans for the future. I will also have bonus stories and 
         random extra material here as well. Enjoy!

    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>
      Anna Petracci lives in southern California with her family and their two cats. 
      She has loved reading and writing stories for as long as she can remember. 
      Sunsky is her first published book. Eventually Anna plans to become a librarian, 
      and spend time with even more books (and the people who love them)!
