    <h2>Kitty Cat, Supercat</h2>
    <p>
        Not counting “Sunsky,” “Kitty Cat, Supercat” is my book that's the 
        farthest along. It is a middle grade fantasy novel (with a helping 
        of science fiction elements) starring a kitten named Kitty who is 
        on a quest to become a Supercat. That is no easy feat; the Supercats 
        only accept the best of the best, and joining them means Kitty must 
        leave her current life to travel to a place unlike anything she’s 
        ever known. Kitty has never been one to turn down a challenge, though, 
        and she is more than ready to prove she has what it takes to become a 
        Supercat.

        Current state of story: In the middle of major edit to clarify plot.

        Likelihood of finishing soon: Define “likely.” And “soon.” If I get 
        back to work editing it (I’ve been working more on other stories lately), 
        there’s a good chance of it not taking too long before the rough draft, 
        at least, is completed.
