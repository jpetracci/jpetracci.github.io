<div class="brief_about">
	<p> I am a software developer living in San Diego wiht my wife and three children. For my job I write software for Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radars at General Atomics. For fun I learn about new computer technologies, play with electronics, go hiking, and sometimes go mountain biking. </p>

	<h1>Projects</h1>
	<p>
	I will be adding some of my side projects to this site in order to have a central location for my ideas. Maybe they will be of interest to someone. 
	<br /><br />
	Two current projects I am working on are a small GPS logger for when I am in the outdoors and don't want to use my phone and a car dash board using my Nexus 7 tablet. It will take me a little bit of time to put the projects in some sort of order for others to see, so I will be adding them soon.
