<div class="brief_about">
	<p> I am a software developer living in San Diego with my wife and three children. For my job I write software for Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radars at General Atomics. For fun I learn about new computer technologies, play with electronics, go hiking, and sometimes go mountain biking. </p>
